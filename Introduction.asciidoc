Introduction
============

In order to design well, you will need to know your options and their
immediate implications.
This applies both to large-scale design and to the small details.

The present text is intended to enlighten on the topology of the
design spaces -- large and small -- which are often encountered when
developing in the Erlang programming language, and the paradigm that
is associated with it.

The target audience is people who already know how to program, and
also knows the basics of Erlang, but perhaps not how to apply them to
real-life design and implementation problems.

For most of the presentation, I've chosen a dialogue-based style --
inspired in part by the question-and-answer form used in ``The Little
LISPer,'' although not by too much.
I hope it will provide a good flow and engage the reader.
(The matters discussed are of course of such an immensely interesting
nature that you would be spellbound under any circumstances, but form
matters as well.)
